# You will need to remove some benches to keep the social distance.
# 
# You are given two arguments:A list of the bench's detail (a tuple of the leftmost coordinate and the length).The minimum social distance between benches.
# 
# In order to make sure that the distance between benches is at least the social distance, we remove some benches.What is the maximum total length of the remaining benches?
# 
# NOTE:
# 
# A list of the bench's detail is sorted.Input:Two arguments:A list of tuples of two integers.An integer.
# 
# Output:An integer.
# 
# Precondition:
# 1 â‰¤ len(benches) â‰¤ 100
