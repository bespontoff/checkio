# The robots have discovered the strange islands in the Bermuda Triangle.
# You need to help robots calculate them.
# 
# The triangular sea area is divided into several triangular areas, numbered from top to bottom and from left to right in row-major order.
# 
# You are given a set of integers with land numbers as input values.
# 
# Triangles with adjacent sides are considered to be a group of the same island.The number of those triangles is the island area.You have to return a list (or an iterable) of the island areas youâ€™ve found.
