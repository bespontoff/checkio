#!/home/bespontoff/PycharmProjects/checkio/venv/bin/checkio --domain=py run remove-accents

# Assuming you are developing a user based system like facebook, you will want to provide the functionality to search for other members regardless of the presence of accents in a username. Without using a 3rd party collation library, you will need to remove the accents from the username before the comparison.
# 
# é - letter with an accent; e - letter without an accent; ̀ and ́ - the stand alone accents;
# 
# 
# 
# Input:A phrase as a string (unicode).
# 
# Output:An accent free Unicode string.
# 
# How it is used:It might be a part of a username verification process or a system that proposes the username based on the first and last name of a user.
# 
# Precondition:0≤|input|≤40
# 
# 
# END_DESC
