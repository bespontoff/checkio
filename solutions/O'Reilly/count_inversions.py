#!/home/bespontoff/PycharmProjects/checkio/venv/bin/checkio --domain=py run count-inversions

# In computer science and discrete mathematics,    aninversionis a pair of places in a sequence where the elements in these places are out of their natural order. So, if we use    ascending order for a group of numbers, then an inversion is when larger numbers appear before lower number in a    sequence.
# 
# Check out this example sequence: (1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 7, 6) and we can see here three inversions
# - 5 and 3;
# - 5 and 4;
# - 7 and 6.
# 
# 
# You are given a sequence of unique numbers and you should count the number of inversions in this sequence.
# 
# Input:A sequence as a tuple of integers.
# 
# Output:The inversion number as an integer.
# 
# Precondition:2 < len(sequence) < 200
# len(sequence) == len(set(sequence))
# all(-100 < x < 100 for x in sequence)
