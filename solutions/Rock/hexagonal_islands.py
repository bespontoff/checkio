#!/home/bespontoff/PycharmProjects/checkio/venv/bin/checkio --domain=py run hexagonal-islands

# This is the mission similar to the“Calculate Islands”mission where you’re dealing with a hexagonal grid.Please, help the robots again.
# 
# The size of the hexagonal grid is12x9('A1' to 'L9').
# 
# It’s characteristics:the alphabet letters represent columns and numbers represent rows;it’s flat topped;the even columns are being shoved down.You are given a set of coastal hexes for all islands as input value.You have to find all islands that those hexes represent and return a list  (tuple or iterable) of that size.
# 
# Note:
# 
# The islands don't include other islands.If there is no island (input == set ()), return [].There are also case that  no sea. (In this case your answer is [108].)
# END_DESC
